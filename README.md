# Task-3-ESP32

# ESP32

ESP32 is a cheap microcontroller featuring Bluetooth and Wi-FiÂ ideal for Internet of Things applications. In this project, I'll design a circuit that tests ESP32 if it's working or not.

# Equipment list and experiment set-up :

ESP
LED 
Resistor

# Experiment Procedure:

Connect the 3.3V pin of the ESP32 to the power rail of the breadboard.
Connect the GND pin of the ESP32 to the ground rail of the breadboard.
connect the anode of the LED to GPIO pin 2 on the ESP32.
Connect the cathode of the LED to one end of the resistor.
Connect the other end of the resistor to the GND rail on the breadboard.

# Results:

As we can see the LED is blinking which means the ESP has no issues.
